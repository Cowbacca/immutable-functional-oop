# Immutability, OOP, and Functional Programming

## Basic Example
The basic example shows first the bag of data plus stateless service approach, then how the same can be achieved with immutable objects.

## OOP Example
While utilising pure functions throughout, the OOP example shows how to implement our shape problem using encapsulated immutable domain objects.

## Functional Example
This time, the problem is solved with functions and bags of data.  A sealed class is used to achieve a union type.
